			<!-- What I do in my free time -->
			I am currenlty (at the time of posting this) on my fourth year working in Information Technology in a
			Helpdesk possition. Outside of work, I use a lot of time during the week spending time with my fiance,
			friends and family. With our friends, we tend to play a lot of board games and card games. Most recently, we
			have gotten into playing Dungeons and Dragons. My fiane and I also have a six year old cat named Hawkeye and
			a one year old basset hound named Willow.

		<p1 class="row">
			Over the next few years, I will be pursuing my Bacholar Degree in Information Technology. During this time,
			I also plan to get a few certificates to help further my carree. One of these includes a security
			sertificate as security is becoming more and more important as time goes on. This is the biggest certificate
			I would like to receive but will also try to get my A+ and Network+ certificates.
