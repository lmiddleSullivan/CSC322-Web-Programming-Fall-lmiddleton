        <h1> The Konami Code </h1>
        <p>One of the most used and famous cheet codes in video games is the Konami Code. This code, UP UP DOWN DOWN
          LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A START, is mostly famous from a game called Contra which released in 1987. The
          purpose of this code was to help the develpers beta test the game by giving both them and the players 30 extra
          lives when starting the game (normally the player starts with 3 and a sinlge hit takes away those lives).
          Contra is a notoriasly hard game and one few dare to concer without the Konami Code</p>

        <h1> The Final Fantasy? </h1>
        <p>The Final Fantasy series is one of the most popular RPG (Role Playing Game) series of all time. Despite its
          name, there have been over 100 games (15, soon to be 16, mainline games. The remainder being spinoffs), so how
          did it get the name, Final Fantasy. The name actually has two different reasons. The first was the devoloper
          SquareSoft (now known as SquareEnix) was on the brink of bankrupcy and tasked series creator, Hironobu
          Sakaguchi, to create the company's swan-song game. At the time, Sakaguchi was also thinking of retiring from
          game development and going back to university so this was to be his and SquareSofts "Final Fanstasy", hince
          the name of the franchise.

          *SquareSoft and Enix, another company on the brink of bankrupcy and the creators of the Dragon Quest series,
          later merged together to form SquareEnix </p>

        <h1> From Card Games to Video Games </h1>
        <p>Nintendo didn't always make video games. The company actually started in 1889 as a hanafuda playing cards company. As the years went on, the company then grew into the giant we know today, with the success of the Famicom in Japan and the Nintendo Entertainment System in the USA and Europe. With the release of this console, the company sored into the main stream of creating video games thanks to the suscess of games like Super Mario Brothers, The Legend of Zelda and many more.  </p>
